### Background/Motive

We've all been thereâ€”spending way too much time setting up and styling components from scratch. It's a pain and slows down the fun part of building awesome stuff. That's why we created ProtoUI. By combining the power of React and TypeScript with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, we're here to make your development process smoother and more enjoyable. Now you can focus on what really matters: creating amazing applications without the hassle.

### TL;DR

ProtoUI strikes a balance between completely unstyled components and overly styled libraries. It offers pre-styled components that are easily customizable, giving you the best of both worlds.
